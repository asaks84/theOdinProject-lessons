    <!-- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
         Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand 
         with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
         It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div 
         (which can go directly in your HTML).
         
         There are several different ways to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Feel free to use any or play with each of them: 
         - float/clear
         - inline-block
         - flexbox
         - CSS Grid

         Be careful with borders and margins, as they can adjust the size of the squares! 
         Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them,
         leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
         
         Hint: “Hovering” is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends when your mouse 
         leaves it. You can set up event listeners for either of those events as a starting point.
         
         There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
         - adding a new class to the div.
         - changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.

         Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send
         the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. 
         Once entered, the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before 
         (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. Tip: Set the limit for 
         the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer 
         resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that 
         we want to prevent.
         
         Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JavaScript function run when 
         one is clicked.
         
         You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without 
         changing the total amount of pixels used.
         
         (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of a square from 
         black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse 
         change it to a completely random RGB value.

         Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so 
         that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
